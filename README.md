# Task Manager App - Todo

This is a **Task Manager App** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) which allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. The app provides features such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks, with real-time feedback using toast notifications.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Create new tasks and add them to the list.

- **Update Task**: Modify existing tasks.

- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

- **Toast Notifications**: Instant feedback for actions such as task creation, update, and deletion.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Built using React for a dynamic, interactive UI.

- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express, connected to a MongoDB database for storing task data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:

  - React

  - Web Vitals

  - React Toastify for notifications

- **Backend**:

  - Node.js

  - Express

  - MongoDB (using Mongoose)
